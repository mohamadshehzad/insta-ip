### 🔍 What Does Your IP Address Expose?

- **Your device’s location** (city, country, sometimes ZIP)
- **Internet service provider (ISP)** and network type
- **Browser, operating system, and hardware info**
- **Your behavior patterns** via linked cookies and sessions

### ⚠️ 7 Hidden IP Privacy Risks

#### 1. 🎯 Targeted Hacking Attacks
Hackers can launch **DDoS attacks** or probe your network using exposed IP addresses.

> _“Can someone hack me through my IP?” – Yes, if your IP is public and unprotected._

#### 2. 💸 Personalized Price Discrimination
E-commerce websites change prices based on your IP’s location. That same flight may cost more in New York than in India.

#### 3. 👨‍💼 ISP or Employer Surveillance
Your **ISP or company** can track your activity via IP logs — even in incognito mode.

#### 4. 🚫 Streaming Geo-Blocks
Netflix, Hulu, and others restrict content based on IP geolocation — no anime in the UK, no HBO in India.

#### 5. 📊 Advertiser Profiling
Ad platforms track your browsing behavior tied to your IP address and serve targeted ads accordingly.

#### 6. 🔓 Accidental IP Leaks
Many apps and websites **leak your IP** through insecure connections, especially on public Wi-Fi.

#### 7. ⚖️ Legal Liability via Logs
IP logs can be subpoenaed. If illegal activity occurs on your IP, **you may be held responsible.**

### 🛡️ How to Protect Your IP (3 Actionable Steps)

#### ✅ Step 1: Use a No-Logs VPN
Choose a reputable VPN that doesn’t store logs. This masks your IP from ISPs and hackers.

#### ✅ Step 2: Enable DNS-over-HTTPS (DoH)
This encrypts your DNS queries, hiding your browsing history even from your ISP.

#### ✅ Step 3: Run a Leak Audit
Use tools like Insta-IP to test for IP, WebRTC, and DNS leaks instantly.

## 2. 🧱 Page Layout Using Your Current Structure

If you're using a custom page (like `pages/blog/[slug].js`), you can use this layout inside your JSX component:

### ✅ `components/BlogPostLayout.js` (Create this file)

```jsx
const BlogPostLayout = ({ title, date, children }) => {
  return (
    <div className="max-w-3xl mx-auto px-6 py-10">
      <h1 className="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-2">{title}</h1>
      <p className="text-sm text-gray-500 mb-6">Published on {date}</p>
      <article className="prose lg:prose-lg">{children}</article>
    </div>
  );
};

export default BlogPostLayout;
